This is going to be a weather app, in which the user will be able to do the following:



- search for a city âˆš
- view current weather conditions for that city (in console log)
- presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- view the UV index
- am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
-I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
- I click on a city in the search history *DOH*
- I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
- I open the weather dashboard
- I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```

i was ultilately unable to pull from local storage. 

here is a photo of my website:


    ! [my_website](./website.png)

the local storage issue happened here:

! [local_storage_issue](./localstorage.png)

but, i know that my AJAX was pulling correctly because of my console log

! [console_ajax](./ajaxconsole.png)

i tried to write out how i would getItem from local storage after, but had no way of testing it to see if it would work.
